							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
							<p>	I'm an artist, animator, social media personality, author, and insperator. I am the face, as well as the creative mind behind the art YouTube channel ‘Willow Tress’, a highly subscribed and viewed channel, which is filled with live streamed art and live interactions with others in the chat as well as I do commissions for those who ask.</p>
						</header>
						<p>	In 2017 I began my YouTube channel, presenting animation and drawing tutorials using digital as well as traditional methods. Over time the channel has transitioned to have more entertainment content as a core part of my content lineup. My social media presence on other platforms carries over to, Deviant art, where I post every piece of art I have done. </p>

							<h2>FAQ</h2>
							<details>
								<summary>What advice do you have for my lack of confidence in my own art?</summary>
								<p>It is hard to have confidence in your art. You find tiny errors and issues in your own art so it is indeed  hard to do.</p>

							I also have a playlist you might find helpful:
								 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8L-0VR6PP4&list=PLNaAcA0yN3KZ3JAnd4tC3XhKGSkkT5yKI">this playlist is to help you better yourself from doubt.</a>

									<p> All I can say is I also go through a vulnerable stage whenever I finish something (or sometimes half way through) but in order to produce anything an artist needs to stick their neck out, take the risk and push through the self doubt.</p></p>
									</details>

									<details>
									<summary>What digital tablet(s) do you use?</summary>
									<p>I use a Huion model: H610PRO , which is a pad tablet for professional use. For beginners and people on a budget I recommend a pad tablet, the kind where you draw on a touch-sensitive pad with a stylus, while looking at your monitor. They can be very good and fairly cheap, especially if you get it second hand from ebay or something.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary> What traditional materials do you use to draw? </summary>
							<p> Sketch book and pen or pencil with White eraser. I also use oil paint, watercolor and or acrylic paint as well.</p>
